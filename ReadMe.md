## Ontology
The relationship that the three individuals have in common is their high involvement in summer camps. The individuals at different capacities worked closely with different kinds of summer camps which is a significant part of thier experience. We want the readers to know about these individuals who worked at summer camps and important aspects of thier lives. That is who are they as a person, what kind of academic path they have chosen for themselves and what their interests are. We believe when poeple see a website with profiles of individuals who have high involvement in summer camps, they would be interested to know the information we presented. The content is similar for all of them and focuses on the similar aspects of all the 3 individuals in focus. 

## Taxonomy
The headings of the website is "Leaders of Summer Camp". That is an itroduction to these individuals to whom summer camp has been an important aspect of their lives. This the similarity that all 3 inidividuals has and is used as the theme to bring these three different people under the same roof. That is why the heading of the main home page cleraly gives people the first idea that the individuals have a strong bond with summer camps. It presents a brief bio of that involvement. Then once they navigate further they can learn more about the individual themselves which consists of their basic information, their academic life and their interests. These choices were made because among all the information that these individuals presented, all 3 similarly talked about these aspects of their lives.  All the information are clearly labelled so the reader will have no confusion on identifying various sections.  Each of the inidividual pages has the heading with the individual's name so the reader can easily know whom they are reading about. 

## Choreography
For the order of the information, the landing page captures the strong similarity each of the individuals have. After the user reads about their involvement at summer camp, they can click on their pictures to go onto their profiles. The first thing a visitor will notice when they go into the inidividual profiles is the image of the student. Underneath that directly is the about section, so we want to guide our visitors to learn more about the inidividuals. After the information about their academics and their interests is divided neatly with its own individual headngs so readers can smoothly follow and learn these aspects. The students are also organized alphabetically which made the most sense to do.
