	<h2>Academics</h2>
		<p>As far as my academic career used to be, I was very into biology in high school. I would attend science competitions and fairs to present research I had begun through a special science research program in my school (which I credit my acceptance to the University of Rochester to). Since I was still a teenager, I had not really explored many fields up to this point and although the idea of biology excited me, I do not believe I was truly passionate about it. I had always been into video games and technology since I was old enough to operate a screen, so it seemed logical that I would like computer science, but my school did not offer anything in the field, so I entered the University of Rochester with a major in biology. Once I arrived at college, I continued with my track for a year or two before I began taking classes in computer science and instantly fell in love with it. I did not realize how much I would truly enjoy the field but I am extremely happy I will end up being able to complete my major within the 4 years even with some extra classes from other fields under my belt.</p>
	
	<h2>Recent Life</h2>
		<p>My hobbies slightly changed when I arrived to college. I, for the most part, stopped playing tennis and picked up basketball as my favorite sport. Since then I've tried to play nearly every day, and I'm currently the captain of the men's club basketball team here at the University of Rochester. It's been a very different experience to transition from an individually dependent sport such as tennis to a fully organized team sport like basketball. It's been a learning experience and really has helped me grow as a person in regards to my ability to work well with other people / teammates. My interest in gaming remains mostly unchanged, and I'm still keeping up to date with all the changing information in that industry.</p>
