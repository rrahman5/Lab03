				<h2> About </h2>

				<p>My name is Jonathan Roman. I'm from Tenafly, NJ and was born September 6th, 1997. I currently attend the University of Rochester with a major in Computer Science. MY hobbies include playing video games and basketball, both of which I participate in groups around campus for.</p>

				<h2>Academics</h2>

				<p>I entered the University of Rochester with a major in biology. Once I arrived at college, I continued with my track for a year or two before I began taking classes in computer science and instantly fell in love with it. I did not realize how much I would truly enjoy the field but I am extremely happy I will end up being able to complete my major within the 4 years even with some extra classes from other fields under my belt.</p>

				<h2>Interests</h2>

				<p>My hobbies slightly changed when I arrived to college. I, for the most part, stopped playing tennis and picked up basketball as my favorite sport. Since then I've tried to play nearly every day, and I'm currently the captain of the men's club basketball team here at the University of Rochester. It's been a learning experience and really has helped me grow as a person in regards to my ability to work well with other people / teammates. My interest in gaming remains mostly unchanged, and I'm still keeping up to date with all the changing information in that industry.</p>
