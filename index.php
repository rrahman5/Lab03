<p>My name is Jonathan Roman. I'm from Tenafly, NJ and was born September 6th, 1997. </p>
		<p>Throughout high school I would work as a part-time tennis coach, though mostly had very light hours (about 4-5 hours a week). The hours were fairly flexible and I could pick up lessons whenever my local tennis club was teaching them, allowing me to change my schedule regularly as needed. At the time I was on the varsity tennis team so the only prerequisite I needed was to be able to play and have the patience to deal with children aged anywhere from 6-14. This was my first job I received on my own as well, which was different but educational for a 15-year-old me. Over the summer, I also taught at the summer camp which was a lot more demanding, as the hours would often be, besides for certain exceptions, 9am-4pm.</p>
		<p>I have also worked as a warehouse employee for my dad, I would often be moving and packaging boxes and/or searching for items that needed to be shipped in the warehouse in order to package. Although it was not the most entertaining job in the world, I learned a lot about my dad's company and would be able to spend a lot of time working with my siblings along with my dad.</p>

<p>I was born in Durham, North Carolina and then spent a year of my infancy in New York City before moving to Blacksburg, 
Virginia for most of the remainder of my childhood.

		<p>My last job was as a Recreation Counselor for Hofstra Summer Camps. There I watched a group of fifth grade boys and eighth grade girls and led them through recreational activities. During my last week I assisted a photography counselor with a different group of kids. Before that job, I had a paid part in the play Sistas on Fire, a show about the hardships African American women face in America. My first job was an activities specialist for Sesame Flyers. There I taught java to 6th graders during an after school program. Outside of work, I’ve done many hours of community service. In high school I started a Toys for Tots drive. I’ve also done campaign work in a mayoral election. At Grace Cathedral I worked as an Audiovisual board operator.</p>
