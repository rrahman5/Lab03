		<p>Throughout high school I would work as a part-time tennis coach, though mostly had very light hours (about 4-5 hours a week). The hours were fairly flexible and I could pick up lessons whenever my local tennis club was teaching them, allowing me to change my schedule regularly as needed. At the time I was on the varsity tennis team so the only prerequisite I needed was to be able to play and have the patience to deal with children aged anywhere from 6-14. This was my first job I received on my own as well, which was different but educational for a 15-year-old me. Over the summer, I also taught at the summer camp which was a lot more demanding, as the hours would often be, besides for certain exceptions, 9am-4pm.</p>
		<p>I have also worked as a warehouse employee for my dad, I would often be moving and packaging boxes and/or searching for items that needed to be shipped in the warehouse in order to package. Although it was not the most entertaining job in the world, I learned a lot about my dad's company and would be able to spend a lot of time working with my siblings along with my dad.</p>

		<p>My first official paid job was as a camp counselor and photographer at the Chatham Hall summer camps (held at my high school). I had various volunteer jobs before then, including as a film camp counselor, another camp counselor, a production assistant, and more. This past summer I worked as a paid counselor at Indiana University’s Digital Cinema Academy camp teaching high school students about film and videography.</p>
		<p>During my second year at college I began three new positions. First, I got the job of a Study Zone Leader, which is a peer academic support position run through the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning. My second position was as a paid notetaker, meaning I take notes for any student(s) who may be unable to do so. This position is managed by the Office for Disability Resources. The third position was a Meridian, meaning I give tours and assist the admissions office at the University of Rochester. Though it keeps me busy, I still maintain all three of these positions and just this semester I was promoted to the position of Head Study Zone Leader.</p>

		<p>My last job was as a Recreation Counselor for Hofstra Summer Camps. There I watched a group of fifth grade boys and eighth grade girls and led them through recreational activities. During my last week I assisted a photography counselor with a different group of kids. Before that job, I had a paid part in the play Sistas on Fire, a show about the hardships African American women face in America. My first job was an activities specialist for Sesame Flyers. There I taught java to 6th graders during an after school program. Outside of work, I’ve done many hours of community service. In high school I started a Toys for Tots drive. I’ve also done campaign work in a mayoral election. At Grace Cathedral I worked as an Audiovisual board operator.</p>
