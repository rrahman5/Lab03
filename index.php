					<p class="info">My first official paid job was as a camp counselor and photographer at the Chatham Hall summer camps (held at my high school). I had various volunteer jobs before then, including as a film camp counselor, another camp counselor, a production assistant, and more. This past summer I worked as a paid counselor at Indiana Universityâ€™s Digital Cinema Academy camp teaching high school students about film and videography.</p>
