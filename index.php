		<p> Over the summer, I also taught at the summer camp which was a lot more demanding, as the hours would often be, besides for certain exceptions, 9am-4pm.</p>

		<p>My first official paid job was as a camp counselor and photographer at the Chatham Hall summer camps (held at my high school). I had various volunteer jobs before then, including as a film camp counselor, another camp counselor, a production assistant, and more. This past summer I worked as a paid counselor at Indiana Universityâ€™s Digital Cinema Academy camp teaching high school students about film and videography.</p>

		<p>My last job was as a Recreation Counselor for Hofstra Summer Camps. There I watched a group of fifth grade boys and eighth grade girls and led them through recreational activities. </p>
